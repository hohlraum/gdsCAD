v0.3.2, 11.12.13 -- CellArray now supports non-orthogonal spacing
                 -- Block uses attribute .spacing
                 -- Use git_version for automatic distribution numbering from git tag
v0.3.3, 11.12.13 -- git_version module now included in distribution
v0.3.4, 11.12.13 -- fixed git_version absent from MANIFEST
v0.3.5, 11.12.13 -- automatic version numbering now correctly updated gdsCAD.__version__
v0.3.6, 12.12.13 -- fixed installation to include missing resource files
v0.3.7, 14.02.14 -- More colors for layer numbers greater than six (Matthias Blaicher)
v0.4.0, 19.05.14 -- Make only cells with conflicting names unique during saving.
                    This change effects the API of the Layout.save() call.
                 -- Use numpy for conversion to GDS internal coordinates while saving
                 -- Fixed Elements constructor for 1-element lists
                 -- Track references to Elements and CellReferences separately
                 -- Cache bounding box property
                 -- Removed .uniquify_names methods. Uniqification is applied 
                    if and only if the name has a duplicate
v0.4.1, 05.06.14 -- Allow Boundaries with unlimited number of points via multiple XY entries
v0.4.2, 15.09.14 -- Boundaries are now closed as they should be (thanks Phil)
                    gdsImport loads all Boundary points (including final closing point) from file
v0.4.3, 07.10.14 -- Fixed Boundaries to again accept non-numpy point lists
                    Removed deprecated labels attribute from Cell
                    Reduced internal uses of Cell._references
v0.5.0, 12.12.14 -- Added Ellipse boundary (cjermain)
                 -- Added missing area method to base classes
                 -- Fixed bug when objects are defined with integers then 
                    translated by float (cjermain)
                 -- Added missing flatten method
v0.5.1, 05.02.15 -- Added to_path and to_boundary conversion methods
