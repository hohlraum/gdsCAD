# Updates the package version number to reflect the git tag of the current commit.
#
# There are two normal use cases:
#  python setup.py sdist: Building a source distribution. This is expected to
#         take place in a folder tracked by git. The return value of "git --tags"
#         is taken as the version number, and this is stored in version_file
#         as part of the distribution.
#  python setup.py install: Here the version number is taken from the value
#         stored in version_file
#
# The file version_file should not be tracked. Doing so will lead to version
# recursion, since it is updated only after the latest version has been
# committed and tagged.
#
# To use this script, simply import it your setup.py file, and use the
# results of get_version() as your package version, and add the locally defined
# command 'sdist' as a cmdclass:
#
# from git_version import get_version, sdist
#
# setup(
#     version=get_git_version(),
#     cmdclass={"sdist": sdist },
#     .
#     .
# )
