gdsCAD -- Simple GDSII design in Python
=======================================

gdsCAD is a simple, but powerful, Python package for creating, reading, and
manipulating GDSII layout files. It's suitable for scripting and interactive
use. It excels particularly in generating designs with multiple incrementally
adjusted objects. gdsCAD uses matplotlib to visualize everything from individual
geometry primitives to the entire layout.

A Simple Example
================

Here is a simple example that shows the creation of some text with alignment
features. It involves the creation of drawing geometry, ``Cell`` and 
a ``Layout`` . The result is saved as a GDSII file, and also displayed
to the screen:: 

    import os.path 
    from gdsCAD import *

    # Create some things to draw:
    amarks = templates.AlignmentMarks(('A', 'C'), (1,2))
    text = shapes.Label('Hello\nworld!', 200, (0, 0))
    box = shapes.Box((-500, -400), (1500, 400), 10, layer=2)

    # Create a Cell to hold the objects
    cell = core.Cell('EXAMPLE')
    cell.add([text, box])
    cell.add(amarks, origin=(-200, 0))
    cell.add(amarks, origin=(1200, 0))

    # Create two copies of the Cell
    top = core.Cell('TOP')
    cell_array = core.CellArray(cell, 1, 2, (0, 850))
    top.add(cell_array)

    # Add the copied cell to a Layout and save
    layout = core.Layout('LIBRARY')
    layout.add(top)
    layout.save('output.gds')

    layout.show()
